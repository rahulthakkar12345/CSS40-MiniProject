                There are a number of reasons you may need a block of text and when you do, a random paragraph can be the perfect solution.

If you're a programmer and you need random text to test the program, using these paragraphs can be the perfect way to do this. Anyone who's in search of realistic text for a project can use one or more of these random paragraphs to fill their need.
                Improve Writing
                For writers looking for a way to get their creative writing juices flowing, using a random paragraph can be a great way to do this. One of the great benefits of this tool is that nobody knows what is going to appear in the paragraph. This can be leveraged in a few different ways to force the writer to use creativity. For example, the random paragraph can be used as the beginning paragraph of a story that the writer must finish. I can also be used as a paragraph somewhere inside a short story, or for a more difficult creative challenge, it can be used as the ending paragraph. In every case, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the random paragraph into the story.

However, the output is quite different (can be see on demo page). Its depends on you what you want to produce. Here the main output (in regards to accordion) difference between radio and checkbox type.

Radio input: Close other opened accordion when select a new one but not toggle same accordion.
Checkbox input: Toggle (show / hide) accordion contents but not close others.
Now, its your choice which type of output you want to get. -->
